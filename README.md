# KVI: a Key Value database written in Inko

KVI is a key-value database written in [Inko](https://inko-lang.org). The
purpose of KVI is not to write the next best replacement for
Redis/Dragonfly/etc, but rather to show what a reasonably complex Inko program
looks like to those potentially interested in using Inko. In addition, we may
use it for benchmarking and testing new Inko features.

## Requirements

- Inko `main`, at least for the time being
